Required Files
--------------
1. Gaussian output file (.log)
2. Gaussian header file

Execution Steps
---------------

1. Generate geometries:
   Run geometries.py. This script reads the displacement vectors from the Gaussian output
   and generates the corresponding geometries for each vibrational mode. It creates a folder
   for each mode and subfolders for each scaling factor, e.g., vib1/vib1_0.00.xyz.

2. Generate Gaussian input files:
   Run gaussian_input_generator.py. This script creates Gaussian input files
   (e.g., vib1_0.00.com) for each scaling factor, preparing them for subsequent point calculations.

3. Submit calculations:
   Run lanzador.py to submit all Gaussian calculations.

   Optional: Run check_calculation.py to verify that each calculation finished with normal termination.

4. Fit potentials:
   Run fitting.py. This script fits the potential energy surface for each mode. It generates:
   - energies.dat: energies vs. displacement for each mode
   - fit_coefficients.dat: fitted quadratic, cubic, and quartic coefficients per mode
   - all_vibrations.pdf: graphs showing potentials and their polynomial fits

5. Compute wavefunctions and Wigner functions:
   Run wigner.py. Using the fitted potentials, this script calculates:
   - Ground state wavefunctions (via finite differences)
   - Wigner functions at P=0
   - Gaussian fits of the Wigner functions (W(x) =A*exp(-(x-a)^2 / (2*sigma^2)))
   - Output files: wigner_gaussian.dat (Gaussian fit parameters) and wave_wigner.pdf (plots)
